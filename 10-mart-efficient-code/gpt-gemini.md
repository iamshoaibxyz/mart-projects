### Supporting Services
- **Database (Postgres)**: Store all persistent data.

- **Load Balancing**: Implement load balancing for distributing incoming traffic efficiently.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement centralized monitoring and logging (e.g., Prometheus for monitoring, ELK stack for logging).

By adhering to these responsibilities and best practices, you can build a scalable, maintainable, and robust e-commerce platform.

## Explanation

### 1. **Auth Service**
Handles user and company authentication and authorization, including registration, login, logout, and token management.

### 2. **User Profile Service**
Manages user and company profiles, allowing users 




When designing a modern e-commerce system with multiple types of users such as companies, customers, shops, third-party warehouses, and affiliate marketers, it's essential to strike a balance between separation of concerns and maintainability. Here’s a deeper analysis of whether these entities should be separate services:

### Separate Services Analysis

1. **Auth Service** (Auth-User and Auth-Company):
   - **Purpose:** Handles authentication and authorization for users and companies.
   - **Endpoints:** 
     - `/register` (for user and company)
     - `/login` (for user and company)
     - `/logout` (for user and company)
     - `/refresh-token`
   - **Reason for Separation:** Authentication is a core service that needs to be secure and scalable. Keeping it separate ensures that authentication concerns do not interfere with other business logic.

2. **User Profile Service**:
   - **Purpose:** Manages user profiles (both customers and companies).
   - **Endpoints:** 
     - `/profile/me` (get, update, delete)
     - `/profile/{user_id}` (admin access)
   - **Reason for Separation:** User profile management includes personal information and settings that are distinct from authentication and other business logic.

3. **Product Service**:
   - **Purpose:** Manages product catalog and details.
   - **Endpoints:** 
     - `/products` (list, create, update, delete)
     - `/products/{product_id}` (get)
   - **Reason for Separation:** Product management is a core business function and requires specialized handling and optimization.

4. **Inventory Service**:
   - **Purpose:** Manages inventory levels and warehouse data.
   - **Endpoints:** 
     - `/warehouses` (list, create, update, delete)
     - `/warehouses/{warehouse_id}` (get)
     - `/stock-levels` (list, update)
   - **Reason for Separation:** Inventory management is a distinct domain that includes complex logic related to stock levels and warehouse operations.

5. **Order Service**:
   - **Purpose:** Manages customer orders and order items.
   - **Endpoints:** 
     - `/orders` (list, create, update, delete)
     - `/orders/{order_id}` (get)
   - **Reason for Separation:** Order processing includes distinct workflows and logic that benefit from being isolated from other services.

6. **Payment Service**:
   - **Purpose:** Manages payment processing and status.
   - **Endpoints:** 
     - `/payments` (list, create)
     - `/payments/{payment_id}` (get)
   - **Reason for Separation:** Payments require secure handling and integration with external payment gateways, making it a specialized service.

7. **Email/Notification Service**:
   - **Purpose:** Manages email notifications and other user notifications.
   - **Endpoints:** 
     - `/emails` (send, status)
     - `/notifications` (list, create)
   - **Reason for Separation:** Handling emails and notifications separately ensures that these asynchronous tasks do not slow down other services.

8. **Review and Rating Service**:
   - **Purpose:** Manages product reviews and ratings.
   - **Endpoints:** 
     - `/reviews` (list, create, update, delete)
     - `/reviews/{review_id}` (get)
   - **Reason for Separation:** Reviews and ratings are a distinct function that directly impacts user experience and product evaluation.

9. **Affiliate Service**:
   - **Purpose:** Manages affiliate marketers and their sales.
   - **Endpoints:** 
     - `/affiliates` (list, create, update, delete)
     - `/affiliates/{affiliate_id}` (get)
     - `/affiliate-sales` (list, create)
   - **Reason for Separation:** Affiliate management includes unique logic related to commissions and tracking sales made by affiliates.

10. **Search Service**:
    - **Purpose:** Manages search functionality and logs.
    - **Endpoints:** 
      - `/search` (perform search)
      - `/search-logs` (list)
    - **Reason for Separation:** Search involves specialized indexing and query optimization which benefits from being a focused service.

11. **Cart Service**:
    - **Purpose:** Manages shopping cart functionality.
    - **Endpoints:** 
      - `/cart` (list, add, remove, update)
      - `/cart/{cart_id}` (get)
    - **Reason for Separation:** Cart management is a fundamental e-commerce feature that involves session management and state tracking.

12. **Analytics Service**:
    - **Purpose:** Manages data analytics and reporting.
    - **Endpoints:** 
      - `/analytics/sales` (get)
      - `/analytics/products` (get)
    - **Reason for Separation:** Analytics often require heavy data processing and should be decoupled from real-time operations to avoid performance hits.

### Potential Consolidation

While the above services provide a clear separation of concerns, in practice, some services might be consolidated for simplicity, especially during the initial phases of the project. For example:
- **Auth and User Profile Service** could be combined initially and then split as the system scales.
- **Email and Notification Service** might be merged into a single service handling all user communications.

By organizing services and their respective endpoints in this manner, you can ensure a clean, maintainable, and scalable e-commerce architecture.

You cannot directly delete a token from the headers on the client-side (e.g., user's browser) for security reasons. JWT tokens are stateless, meaning the server doesn't maintain active token information. Here are two common approaches for handling logout in a JWT-based authentication system:

**1. Invalidate Token on Server-Side (Not Recommended):**

- This approach is not generally recommended due to scalability concerns. It would require storing token information on the server and checking a blacklist of invalidated tokens on every request. 

**2. Set an Earlier Expiration Time:**

- When the user logs out, the server responds with a success message but sets a much earlier expiration time in the JWT token itself. This effectively renders the token unusable for future requests.
- The client-side can then clear the token from its storage.

Here's an example implementation in Python using FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends

from your_app.models import User
from your_app.auth import get_current_user

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/logout")
async def logout(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    # Optional: Log logout event or perform any other actions
    return {"message": "Successfully logged out"}
```

This approach doesn't require storing token information on the server, but it's important to set a suitable token expiration time for security and performance.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Consider implementing refresh tokens for long-lived sessions. A refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires. This can improve user experience by avoiding frequent logins.
- Securely store and manage JWT tokens on both the server-side and client-side.

By following these guidelines, you can create a secure and efficient logout functionality for your e-commerce application using JWT authentication.
